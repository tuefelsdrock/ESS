BFaloona Notes
UWE-Ruby TA
Nov 30, 2011

Very interesting project. Many of my notes are style related, so please accept them
as constructive ideas. 

The specs you wrote for ruby looked clean and clear. 

Regarding you project, In addition to the comments below, I made 4 comments in a 2 files, 
marked with '## BFaloona Notes'.

Great use of comments throughout, but in general you might want to focus more on code clarity 
so others can read your code easier. Class names were a bit terse, and a few extra spaces in assignment
statements might have helped.

The web output was confusing to me, but I don't know the domain. The Readme could have used
a paragraph explaining the app in a bit more detail (although I did find that in lib/ess.rb).

In general it seemed like there were too many instance variables (but again, I don't know the domain).

The big things to focus on if you refactor would be to make better use of erb (or some other template language)
and to write some tests for it.
